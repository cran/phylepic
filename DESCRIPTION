Description: A collection of utilities and 'ggplot2' extensions to assist with
  visualisations in genomic epidemiology. This includes the 'phylepic' chart,
  a visual combination of a phylogenetic tree and a matched epidemic curve.
  The included 'ggplot2' extensions such as date axes binned by week are
  relevant for other applications in epidemiology and beyond. The approach is
  described in Suster et al. (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.04.02.24305229>.
